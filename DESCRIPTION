Description: The routine gof_test() in this package runs the
    goodness-of-fit test using various test statistic for multivariate data. 
    Models under the null hypothesis can either be simple or allow for parameter estimation.
    p values are found via the parametric bootstrap (simulation). 
    The routine gof_test_adjusted_pvalues() runs several tests and then finds a 
    p value adjusted for simultaneous inference.
    The routine gof_power() allows the estimation of the power of the tests. 
    hybrid_test and hybrid_power do the same by first generating a Monte Carlo data set under
    the null hypothesis and then running a number of two-sample methods.
    The routine run.studies() allows a user to quickly study the power of a new method and 
    how it compares to those included in the package via a large number of case studies.
    For details of the methods and references see the included vignettes.
